Prot is a C++ core of task scheduler, with support for users and auto-task setter based on user questionaries for recurrent tasks.

Powered by a engine parser of json forms, that provides the set up, pipeline and question/answer front end to custom the auto-task collection called "taskstories".

To compile the project you need to have:
- Installed boost 1.69 libs and includes in your machine as CMake will look for it in the local machine
- C++ 17 compiler
- cmake > 3.10

sudo apt install gcc g++ make cmake

To build:

From prot root directory:

1- mkdir build
2- cd build
3- cmake ..
4- make


It is unlicensed, you can only use it to learn from the code. Reach me for commercial traits or secondary uses.
Working in the future to provide a commercial solution.
