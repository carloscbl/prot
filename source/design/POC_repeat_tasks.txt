Repeat tasks based on periods POC

# the main idea is that an app have a close range of possible tasks.
# Every individual tasks have a period pattern "frequency" wich is mapped in the frequency files
# If is a wildcard tasks is hold into a previous set of tasks pattern, being based on day_week=weekly, day_month=monthly
#   meaning that the specific set of tasks need to be recreated to the follow period -> next week -> next monthly with the same pattern

# Bussines logic is to delete past(expired) tasks by 1 day.
# in order to achieve this projection on time we can use few strategies:

#   1ยบ COPY the current stored set of tasks into the next period
    how: match app in db, get tasks from db, copy them ,extract frequency (individuals and wildcard), solve next period (current + 1<T_period> ), set into db
    how2:
        - An worker watcher will dogward current and follow periods ,
        - Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period
    pros: straighforward, lightweight since dont require answers, should not have breakpoints, since recreated on CRUD App QA
    cons: external answers will be stored in the future anyway, doenst support next period be different from current

#   2ยบ Recreate them based on a set of answers(can be different of the original):
    how: match app in db, get target answers, reproducce secuence of answers, solve next period (current + 1<T_period> ), fake starting point using solver new start, create and expand, set into db
    how2:
        - An worker watcher will dogward current and follow periods ,
        - Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period
    how3:
        -Will requiere a solve a hierarchy of answers..., 
            -if none, use original, answers
            -if selected, use selected, one
            -if multiple, use last one?
    pros: Very flexible system
    Cons: we arent there yet, would need to implement
        GUI  -> selector of answers or edition of answers
        DB   -> store N amount of SETs of answers
        PROT -> Select answers, and replay creation is expensive

this time:
we are goint to go with 1ยบ and "- Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period"

things to do:
create jobs system, cpp and db -> done

maybe is good idea to do it task by task,
flow:
    create task -> get creation id -> set a job with task_id and datetime of job execution (floor<day>(task_start) + period(1)), so if it is on monday, from that monday you should be able to see next monday
    jobs system will be only executed in the day of renovation

    is importan that tasks get only removed at least 1 day after expire
