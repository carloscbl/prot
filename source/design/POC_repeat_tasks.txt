Repeat tasks based on periods POC

# the main idea is that an app have a close range of possible tasks.
# Every individual tasks have a period pattern "frequency" wich is mapped in the frequency files
# If is a wildcard tasks is hold into a previous set of tasks pattern, being based on day_week=weekly, day_month=monthly
#   meaning that the specific set of tasks need to be recreated to the follow period -> next week -> next monthly with the same pattern

# Bussines logic is to delete past(expired) tasks by 1 day.
# in order to achieve this projection on time we can use few strategies:

#   1ยบ COPY the current stored set of tasks into the next period
    how: match app in db, get tasks from db, copy them ,extract frequency (individuals and wildcard), solve next period (current + 1<T_period> ), set into db
    how2:
        - An worker watcher will dogward current and follow periods ,
        - Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period
    pros: straighforward, lightweight since dont require answers, should not have breakpoints, since recreated on CRUD App QA
    cons: external answers will be stored in the future anyway, doenst support next period be different from current

#   2ยบ Recreate them based on a set of answers(can be different of the original):
    how: match app in db, get target answers, reproducce secuence of answers, solve next period (current + 1<T_period> ), fake starting point using solver new start, create and expand, set into db
    how2:
        - An worker watcher will dogward current and follow periods ,
        - Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period
    how3:
        -Will requiere a solve a hierarchy of answers..., 
            -if none, use original, answers
            -if selected, use selected, one
            -if multiple, use last one?
    pros: Very flexible system
    Cons: we arent there yet, would need to implement
        GUI  -> selector of answers or edition of answers
        DB   -> store N amount of SETs of answers
        PROT -> Select answers, and replay creation is expensive

this time:
we are goint to go with 1ยบ and "- Instead a worker, every CRUD of an installed app will set a job to copy into the follow period"

things to do:
create jobs system, cpp and db
