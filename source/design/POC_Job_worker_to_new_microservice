POC Move Job worker to new microservice

Main idea is to decouple this from prot service

pros:
    separated trazability
    can be in different machines with different resources

cons:
    maintainability? Maybe is harder to hold together
    

How:
    the idea is to hold in the same prot project but create a new entrypoint for the docker
    create a new cmake subproject
    use lprot lib code in the same way rest_server uses or test_prot does
    just create a new main that directly creates instanciates this
